<b>I taught myself to code</b> to the point of making it my job. 

I've always used PHP, CSS and HTML for personnal project, but I now use it professionally and taught myself JS in the process to make :
- Web Apps (PHP, Symfony, Javascript)
- Websites
- Data-analysis tools (Python, Java)
- Customer-centric platforms (PHP, Symfony, Javascript)

On the software development end, I started off by learning C++ and Java, then moved over to Python in oder to do massive data analysis and tinkering :
- Inputing, merging and cross-reference datas from differents sources and APIs.
- Writing classes, functions and scripts to make those data speak and build a virtual database suited to my company needs

<b>Main languages :</b>

<b>Frameworks :</b>
- Symfony
