<h1 align="center">Hello! I'm Florent QUIJOUX</h1>
<h3 align="center">A French developper and Project Manager</h3>

<b>I taught myself to code</b> in PHP and Python to the point of making it my job to do so. 

I've always used PHP, CSS and HTML for personnal project, but I now use it professionally and taught myself JS in the process to make :
- Websites
- Tools for my team
- Customer-centric platforms

On the software development end, I started off the hard by learning C++ and Java, then moved over to Python in oder to do massive data analysis and tinkering :
- I kwon how to merge datas from stupidly different sources and formats
- I write classes, functions and script to make that data speak
- I use APIs, AI and magic so that incomplete data makes sense.

<b>My weapons of choice :</b>
- Python
- PHP
- HTML / CSS / SCSS
- Javascript / jQuery

<b>I've already deployed production project with those frameworks :</b>
- Symfony
- Wordpress

<b>Back me to a corner and I can do this to save my life :</b>
- C++
- Java
