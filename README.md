<h1 align="center">Hello! I'm Florent QUIJOUX</h1>
<h3 align="center">A French developper and Project Manager</h3>

I taught myself to code in PHP and Python to the point of making it my job to do so. I've always used PHP for personnal project, but I now use it professionally and taught myself JS in the process.

On the software development end, I started off the hard by learning C++ and Java, then moved over to Python in oder to do massive data analysis and tinkering.

My weapons of choice :
- Python
- PHP
- HTML / CSS / SCSS
- Javascript / jQuery

I've already deployed production project with those frameworks :
- Symfony
- Wordpress

Back me to a corner and I can do this to ave my life :
- C++
- Java
